 This repository holds our Lab 8 files

hash.py traverses through all the files on the system, except for the ones we specified
in our inhashable list. It then opens and read each of these files, hashes them, 
and then stores the hash, file path, and date and time in a CSV file. 

filehashes.csv is the output CSV file of hash.py. The first field contains the file path and file name.
The second field contains the hash of the file, and the last field contains the 
date and time.
